## Wine Quality Analysis Based on its chemical content

In this rmd file we will do detailed analysis on different chemical composition of 
white wine and its effect on quality

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library("GGally")
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
wine <- read.csv('wineQualityWhites.csv',header = TRUE)
dim(wine)
```
## Summary information on different variables 
```{r echo=FALSE}

summary(wine)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}

str(wine)
```

## Univariant Data Analysis 

#### Histogram Analysis
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_One}
ggplot(aes(x = quality),data = wine)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .5)+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 10), breaks =  seq(0, 10, 1))
  



#summary(wine$fixed.acidity) names(wine)



```

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = fixed.acidity),data = wine)+
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(aes(x = fixed.acidity),data = wine)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .1)

ggplot(aes(x = volatile.acidity),data = wine)+
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(aes(x = volatile.acidity),data = wine)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .01)

ggplot(aes(x = citric.acid),data = wine)+
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(aes(x = citric.acid),data = wine)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .01)

ggplot(aes(x = chlorides), data = wine)+
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(aes(x = chlorides), data = wine)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.001)

ggplot(aes(x = chlorides), data = wine)+
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(aes(x = chlorides), data = wine)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .001)

ggplot(aes(x = free.sulfur.dioxide), data = wine)+
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(aes(x = free.sulfur.dioxide), data = wine)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)


ggplot(aes(x = pH), data = wine)+
  geom_histogram()
ggplot(aes(x = pH), data = wine)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)

ggplot(aes(x = sulphates), data = wine)+
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(aes(x = sulphates), data = wine)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)


```

```{r echo = FALSE}



ggplot(aes(x = residual.sugar), data = wine)+
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(aes(x = residual.sugar), data = wine)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .1)

```

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = density), data = wine)+
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(aes(x = density), data = wine)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.0005)

```

```{r echo = FALSE}
#names(wine)
#summary(wine$alcohol)

ggplot(aes(x = alcohol), data = wine)+
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(aes(x = alcohol), data = wine)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05)


```

```{r echo=FALSE}

ggplot(aes(x = X),data = wine)+
  geom_histogram()+
  scale_x_continuous()

```










Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
